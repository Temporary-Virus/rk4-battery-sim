# Runge-Kutta 4th order differential equation solver

In numerical analysis, the [Rungeâ€“Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the well-known routine called the Euler Method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations.

This program simulates the charging & discharging of a traditional equivalent circuit model, utilizing Runge-Kutta 4th order to integrate the values plotted.
